Quantum Enhanced Machine Learning Projects

# Project Goal

This research expands on the concept of quantum computing and an expanded Hilbert space and applies it for classical machine learning by implementing the quantum-enhanced version of the K-nearest neighbors algorithm (an existing lazy-learning deterministic classifier).
